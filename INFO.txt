Some things to keep in mind:

1. Make sure that your titles are decrypted and are either .3ds or .cia files
2. All titles must be inside this folder (the one with the Title Manager.bat file)
3. Whenever you extract anything from a .3ds or .cia file, it will go into a folder with the same name as the file, with the extension afterwards (without a ".")
4. Partition #0 (which is always extracted when unpacking a title) can be really large, so make sure you have tons of space left on your computer.
5. When repacking a title, it will never replace the old one.
6. Only folders that have the right files will be recognized by the batch tool.
7. If you want to convert a .3dsx file to a .cia file with a custom banner, then read the "template-banner" folder 

Help with background musics:

1. To add music, go inside the .data folder, then the bgm folder. Make sure that the music is named "Bgm" and has to be
an mp3 file or else it wont work

The name of the default background music is "Dex Arson - Unarmed Ft.  Emily Abela"
